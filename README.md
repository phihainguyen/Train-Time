# Train-Time

Using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and firebase, Train Time was created to be a fun application that tracks expected arrival time of trains that users can add by inputting the train's name, its destination, its first train time departure, and its frequency.

Users can add a train to track by filling the form at the bottom of the page and clicking the submit button to add that train. User will be asked to provide the name of the train they are tracking, the name of its destination, the time the train first runs, and the frequency of the train arrival.
